\title{Compute Regular States’ Strategic Decisions}
\usage{
normal_countries(distance_vector, u = 400, alpha = 800)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance_vector}{A numeric vector of distances among all actors in the
system. The last element represents the hegemon’s position.}

\item{u}{A numeric scalar. Economic utility threshold for regular states.
Default is \code{400}.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric scalar. Strategic influence parameter (strength of the
hegemon). Default is \code{800}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{distances}}{Distances of each state from the military threat.}
\item{\code{probability_B0}}{Probability of opposing without benefit.}
\item{\code{probability_B1}}{Probability of opposing with benefit.}
\item{\code{decision_B0}}{Binary indicator for opposition without benefit.}
\item{\code{decision_B1}}{Binary indicator for opposition with benefit.}
}
}
\description{
Calculates the strategic decisions of regular (non-hegemonic) countries given
their distance from a military threat and the hegemon. The function derives
the probabilities of alignment or opposition under two possible strategic
configurations (\emph{B0} and \emph{B1}), based on the parameters of the model.
}
\details{
The function assumes that the last element of \code{distance_vector}
corresponds to the hegemon’s position, and that the remaining values represent
the distances between regular states and the military threat.

For each state, it computes:
\itemize{
\item \strong{probability_B0}: Probability of opposing without benefit
(decreases with distance).
\item \strong{probability_B1}: Probability of opposing with benefit
(zero if distance > 0.8).
}

Based on these, it determines binary decisions:
\itemize{
\item \strong{decision_B0 = 1} if \eqn{u - \alpha p_{B0} > 0}.
\item \strong{decision_B1 = 1} if \eqn{u - \alpha p_{B1} > 0}.
}

The output can be used as input to higher-level functions such as
\code{\link{hegemonic_decision}} and \code{\link{normal_area}} to analyze
the system’s equilibrium structure.
