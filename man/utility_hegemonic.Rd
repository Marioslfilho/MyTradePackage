\title{Plot Hegemon’s Utility Functions}
\usage{
utility_hegemonic(regulars_position, alpha = 800, u = 400, tau = 600, c = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{regulars_position}{A numeric vector indicating the positions of regular states
on the unit interval \code{[0, 1]}.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric scalar representing the hegemon’s strategic strength or
influence parameter. Default is \code{800}.}

\item{u}{A numeric scalar representing the economic utility threshold. Default is
\code{400}.}

\item{tau}{A numeric scalar representing the military or trade benefit parameter.
Default is \code{600}.}

\item{c}{A numeric scalar representing the cost of defying the military threat.
Default is \code{100}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object displaying the hegemon’s utility as a function of
its position, under different strategic choices.
}
\description{
This function computes and visualizes the hegemon’s utility across different
positions in the political or geographic space, given the distribution of regular
states. It considers three possible strategies for the hegemon: \emph{ally},
\emph{oppose}, and \emph{defy}.
}
\details{
The function computes the hegemon’s utility under three strategic options:
\describe{
\item{\strong{Ally}}{Trading or aligning with the military threat.}
\item{\strong{Oppose}}{Trading with states that oppose the military threat.}
\item{\strong{Defy}}{Opposing while also providing benefits to conditional states.}
}

The plot includes dashed lines representing the regular states’ positions and
dotted lines for the theoretical thresholds \eqn{d^*} and \eqn{d^{**}}.

regular_positions <- seq(0.1, 0.9, by = 0.2)
