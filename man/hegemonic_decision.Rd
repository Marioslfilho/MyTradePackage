\title{Compute the Hegemon’s Strategic Decision}
\usage{
hegemonic_decision(distance_vector, alpha = 800, u = 400, tau = 600)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance_vector}{A numeric vector representing the distances between
states in the system. The last element corresponds to the hegemon’s own
position.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric scalar. Represents the hegemon’s strategic capacity or
power parameter. Default is \code{800}.}

\item{u}{A numeric scalar. Represents the economic utility threshold.
Default is \code{400}.}

\item{tau}{A numeric scalar. Represents the military cost parameter.
Default is \code{600}.}
}
\value{
A character string indicating the hegemon’s equilibrium strategy:
\describe{
\item{\strong{"B0"}}{Oppose without benefit.}
\item{\strong{"B1"}}{Oppose with benefit.}
\item{\strong{"MT"}}{Align with the military threat.}
}
}
\description{
Determines the hegemon’s optimal strategic choice given the configuration of
the international system. The decision is based on the utilities associated
with three possible strategies: \emph{opposition without benefit (B0)},
\emph{opposition with benefit (B1)}, and \emph{alignment with the military
threat (MT)}.
}
\details{
The function evaluates the hegemon’s expected utility for each strategy based
on distances between states and on the model’s structural parameters
(\code{alpha}, \code{u}, and \code{tau}).

Specifically:
\itemize{
\item \strong{B0}: Oppose the military threat without providing benefits.
\item \strong{B1}: Oppose the military threat and provide a benefit to opposing states.
\item \strong{MT}: Align with the military threat and its allies.
}

The hegemon’s position is assumed to correspond to the last element of
\code{distance_vector}. The function calls \code{normal_countries()} to obtain
the system’s equilibrium configuration and derives the hegemon’s total utility
under each alternative. The strategy yielding the highest total utility is
returned as a character code.
