\title{Plot Normal States’ Strategic Area}
\usage{
normal_area(
  distance_vector,
  varies,
  alpha = 800,
  u = 400,
  tau = 600,
  gamma = 200
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance_vector}{A numeric vector representing the baseline distances
among all actors in the system.}

\item{varies}{A numeric vector of length 2 indicating which distance dimensions
vary across the grid.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric scalar. Represents the hegemon’s strategic strength or
capacity parameter. Default is \code{800}.}

\item{u}{A numeric scalar. Represents the economic utility threshold.
Default is \code{400}.}

\item{tau}{A numeric scalar. Represents the military cost parameter.
Default is \code{600}.}

\item{gamma}{A numeric scalar. Represents an additional structural parameter
for the regular states’ payoff. Default is \code{200}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object visualizing the equilibrium regions for regular
states' strategic choices.
}
\description{
This function computes and visualizes the decision regions for \emph{regular states}
(or normal countries) in the model. It evaluates how these states' strategic
choices vary across a two-dimensional grid of distance parameters, conditional
on the hegemon's and the military threat's relative positions and strength.
}
\details{
The function iterates over a sequence of possible distances and computes, for each
configuration, the outcome of \code{normal_countries()} — namely, the strategic
areas corresponding to each decision outcome (e.g., \emph{alignment}, \emph{opposition
with benefit}, \emph{opposition without benefit}).

The resulting plot displays the regions in which each equilibrium strategy arises,
helping visualize how changes in the political or geographic distance structure
affect normal states’ alignment behavior.

The color mapping corresponds to:
\describe{
\item{\strong{"0"}}{Alignment with the military threat (red).}
\item{\strong{"1"}}{Opposition with benefit (blue).}
\item{\strong{"2"}}{Opposition without benefit (green).}
}
